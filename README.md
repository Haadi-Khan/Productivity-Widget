# Productivity-Widget

Tool to keep me on task over the summer

## What does it do?

This widget is comprised of three elements: A pomodoro timer, a todo list (with local storage), and some google sheets embeds for a calendar and goals for the summer.

If you'd like to modify this for your own use you can insert your own link into the iframes and edit them to your liking. Keep in mind the css is set for my own use case so they will most likely not fit your criteria.
